## Description
Project Tech is your first stepping stone to become a well-rounded web developer (or a designer with knowledge of how things are made). You'll build a dynamic prototype of a matching application. You’ll learn about the “softer” skills; reading documentation, collaboration and “harder” skills; how to use the command line, version control, build tools, and code quality.

We’ll focus on what it means to be a web deveveloper, the current landscape of that space, and topics such as privacy, security, diversity, inclusion, accessibility, communication and team work.

Project-tech is an elective course given in Quarter 3 (spring) after the core curriculum of our programme, building further on knowledge acquired in *Internetstandaarden*, *Inleiding Programmeren*, and *Blok Web*. This course is chosen alongside **Frontend 2** and **Back-end**, together making up Block Tech. 

If you’d like to continue with web development after this course, do a tech internship, choose the [Tech Track][track] for the fall semester next year, and pick [Minor Everything Web][minor] in the spring semester after that. Just a quick check if anyone actually reads this: if you see this, please send your teacher a picture of your favorite animal.

_Project-tech is part of the  CMD Amsterdam **design & build space** (technical course) that focusses on   Conceptualizing (2), Imagining and creating (3), Multidisciplinary collaboration (5) & Research (9) competences._ 

The main goals in this course:

* You can design and develop a dynamic matching web application
* You can use version control using Git and GitHub
* You can navigate the terminal and set-up your own development environment
* You can write documentation that other developers understand
* You can explain your code and the cohesion of your application
* You can recognise good quality code, collaborate and review other people's code
